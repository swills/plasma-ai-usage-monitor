# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [20.0.0] — 2026-09-07

### Changed

- Separate authenticated quota observation time from local file activity and
  exclude stale or expired windows from live quota selection.
- Select the earliest future reset independently of the lowest remaining quota.
- Drive reset countdowns from one shared presentation clock.
- Consolidate provider and tool tooltip facts through normalized daily state;
  preserve available zero, unknown values and explicit stale labels.
- Preserve subscription price ranges and validate evidence on individual entries.
- Remove hardcoded fallback activity caps that were not account entitlements.
- Reuse prepared Protobuf config discovery and compact panel sizing fixes.
- Separate development media integrity checks from exact-source candidate
  qualification, with isolated Plasma capture and retained failure diagnostics.

## [19.0.1] — 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- Separate expected catalog review states from actionable drift so lifecycle,
  unavailable-pricing, and transient reachability warnings do not reopen the
  maintainer issue while stale evidence and durable HTTP failures still block.
- Refresh Catalog v7 source-review metadata, add current Gemini pricing and
  replacement metadata, and keep the native Google default on an active model.
- Add regression coverage for the catalog drift exit contracts and report
  classifications.

## [19.0.0] — 2026-08-15

### Added

- Add Catalog v7 lifecycle, source provenance, review state, sequence and hard-expiry metadata.
- Add fixed-point Cost Engine v2 for exact token, generation, video-second,
  request, cache, context, modality, service-tier, route, region and fee pricing.
- Add signed Ed25519 catalog feeds with bounded HTTPS checks, replay protection,
  atomic activation and a protected publication workflow.
- Add immutable estimate provenance to history, provider observations, CSV and
  JSON exports, plus Source Detail explanations, price-change inbox and Local Cost Lab.

### Changed

- Route runtime local estimates through the same catalog Cost Engine used by
  tests and UI, while keeping provider-reported billing authoritative.
- Resolve only exact model IDs and explicit aliases; unknown and retired models
  fail closed instead of receiving a guessed price.
- Keep unknown currency nullable and stop producing new estimates after catalog expiry.

### Fixed

- Correct current OpenAI, Google and Anthropic catalog drift and expose retired
  model replacements without silently changing a configured model.
- Prevent unavailable gateway estimates from being mixed with actual multi-currency billing rows.

## [18.0.0] — 2026-08-08

### Added

- Add applet-owned typed budget policies with transactional schema-v6 storage,
  deterministic legacy migration, config schema-v3 backup/restore and staged
  CRUD through Budget Control.
- Add calendar day, Monday ISO week, calendar month, anchored month and verified
  provider-reset cycle resolution with saved IANA time zones and exact UTC
  half-open intervals.
- Add `budget-pacing-v2` minor-unit results for spent, remaining, consumed,
  projected period end, predicted overrun, safe today, remaining allowance,
  evidence, coverage and compatible previous-period comparison.
- Add scoped OpenAI, Anthropic and validated LiteLLM cost policies, safe label
  snapshots and explicit `Unattributed` reconciliation.
- Add persist-before-delivery warning, critical, exceeded, recovery and reset
  transitions with restart deduplication, DND/cooldown pending state and snooze
  expiry at period reset.

### Changed

- Keep exactly three lazy popup tabs and make Budget Control a searchable,
  accessible master/detail editor with Apply/Cancel and live preview.
- Split quota, observation, cycle and pacing queries into focused native units;
  add policy/observation revision caching and lazy secondary popup work.
- Move budget capability, supported scopes/cycles, review metadata and provider
  notification keys into catalog v6.
- Restrict webhook policy events to an explicit allowlist and keep policy/scope
  IDs out of bounded Prometheus labels, diagnostics and standard reports.

### Fixed

- Prevent missing data, unknown currency precision, mixed value classes,
  currencies or scopes, unstable provider resets and scoped-over-aggregate
  mismatches from becoming fabricated budget guidance.
- Prevent risky-to-unavailable and unavailable-to-safe changes from becoming
  false recoveries, and prevent DND, cooldown or failed delivery from losing a
  policy transition.

## [17.0.0] — 2026-07-29

### Added

- Add Forecast Contract v1 and transactional SQLite schema v5 with separate,
  restart-safe guardrail transition evidence, export, retention, and a
  pre-migration backup.
- Add deterministic quota runway and monthly budget pacing with explicit
  evidence, coverage, UTC boundaries, actual/estimated separation, currency
  compatibility, and typed unavailable reasons.
- Add provider-reported OpenAI and Anthropic scope detail, Runway cards in
  Daily Focus, Source Detail and Analyst, and opt-in transition notifications
  for KDE, Slack, and Discord.
- Add aggregate-only Prometheus guardrail state and predicted-event timing.

### Changed

- Traverse OpenAI usage and daily/monthly cost pagination completely within
  fixed page and retry budgets; partial traversals stay stale or unavailable.
- Keep aggregate and scoped metrics separate and replace scoped rows only after
  a complete successful refresh.
- Rename the neutral Output / Input Ratio card and remove unused subjective
  Analyst components.
- Update the user guide, generated wiki, architecture, capability matrix,
  privacy contract, troubleshooting, release notes, and isolated media policy
  for Runway Guardrails.

### Fixed

- Prevent truncated OpenAI reports from masquerading as complete totals.
- Prevent missing values, mixed currencies, mixed actual/estimated data,
  incomplete UTC days, reset changes, or non-monotonic quota from becoming
  fabricated forecasts.
- Prevent unchanged guardrail states from notifying again after refresh or
  restart and keep high-cardinality scope identifiers out of webhooks and
  Prometheus labels.

## [16.0.1] — 2026-07-26

### Fixed
- Restore Settings labels and other translated QML text by using Plasma's localized runtime context instead of the incompatible `KI18n` singleton path.
- Add a release-blocking localization check so unsupported qualified translation
  calls cannot silently remove QML text again.

## [16.0.0] — 2026-07-26

### Added
- Add Daily Focus and Source Detail with source-specific actions, provenance, freshness, typed metrics, quota windows, and compatible History deep links.
- Add exact UTC half-open Analyst periods and responsive History and Analyst layouts.
- Add optional Anthropic Admin API organization usage and cost reporting with bounded pagination, cache-token metrics, micro-USD parsing, and independent capability state.
- Add PID-, window-, and AT-SPI-bound v16 release media plus a reproducible local release-candidate contract.

### Changed
- Extract Analyst queries, Anthropic Admin parsing and pagination, and catalog-driven provider runtime registration into focused units.
- Refresh the user guide, generated wiki, architecture, capability matrix, privacy material, and ten-surface screenshot set for Control Loop.
- Make QML lint, version policy, release media, source archives, and Fedora lifecycle checks release-blocking and reproducible.

### Fixed
- Keep Analyst date ranges exact across UTC, local time zones, and DST boundaries.
- Keep Anthropic partial usage or cost failures stale or unavailable instead of replacing missing data with zero.
- Preserve Source Detail keyboard return, retained History gaps, mixed-currency failures, and available numeric zero.

## [15.0.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added
- Add one typed Daily State Model for panel, Overview, History freshness, and notifications, with deterministic source priority and nullable metrics.
- Add action-first Overview cards for recovery, lowest synchronized quota, next live reset, separated spend categories, and compact source groups.
- Add retained provider and subscription-tool discovery, explicit chart gaps, compatibility-checked comparisons, and asynchronous History queries.
- Add one asynchronous Analyst snapshot with coverage, sample requirements, compatible drivers, anomaly methodology, and period-specific reports.
- Add fixture-driven daily UI, notification, History, Analyst, performance, and accessibility release gates.

### Changed
- Replace provider connection-count panel semantics with attention, lowest-quota, next-reset, actual-spend, and active-source modes.
- Show each provider and coding tool with its own logo in the daily source list.
- Keep actual provider spend, local estimates, fixed subscription fees, balances, connectivity, and mixed currencies visibly separate.
- Group notification threshold changes per source and suppress stale quota changes while preserving source and action context.
- Document the Daily Control model, v14 compact-mode migration, retained history, Analyst methodology, and reproducible v15 release media.

### Fixed
- Preserve unavailable values as unavailable through panel modes, charts, reports, alerts, and exports instead of coercing them to zero.
- Prevent disabled sources from disappearing from History and prevent missing buckets from rendering as recorded zeroes.
- Prevent superseded History or Analyst requests from replacing newer UI state.

## [14.1.2] — 2026-07-22

### Changed
- Use one source-readiness summary for the panel accessibility label, compact count, and popup footer, including verified local tools and connectivity-only results.
- Present Analyst output/input ratio as a neutral measurement only when compatible history exists, and render missing or zero-activity heatmap days outside the activity gradient.
- Make `docs/user-guide/` the sole editable user-documentation source and gate its generated `docs/wiki/` mirror against drift.
- Generalize the Fedora 44 RPM lifecycle gate around explicit base and candidate packages, with v14.1.1 as the required maintenance-release base.

### Fixed
- Stop unavailable provider cost, remaining-request, and quota defaults from appearing as real zero values or healthy status in compact panel modes.
- Include verified tool-only configurations in panel health and include provider and tool quota windows in the most constrained source display.
- Remove the synthetic output/input `10x` fallback, prompt-quality labels, recommendation text, and trend coloring from Analyst.
- Distinguish a missing heatmap observation from an explicitly recorded zero in hover details.

## [14.1.1] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Support the Antigravity 2.x desktop language server, including its new executable layout and Connect/JSON status contract.
- Show Antigravity 2.x shared five-hour and weekly quota buckets alongside the daemon-reported per-model quota rows.

### Fixed
- Discover the Antigravity 2.x `resources/bin/language_server` process and validate its bundled localhost TLS certificate instead of accepting only the legacy IDE extension layout.

## [14.1.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added
- Add opt-in Google Antigravity subscription monitoring through its authenticated local daemon.
- Detect Standard, Pro, Ultra, Ultra 5x, Ultra 20x, Enterprise, and unknown plans automatically.
- Show every daemon-reported model variant with live remaining quota, reset time, availability, source, and freshness.
- Add Antigravity readiness, connection testing, refresh scheduling, stale-snapshot recovery, and grouped quota warnings.

### Changed
- Generalize subscription cards so browser and local-daemon sync sources use accurate labels and refresh actions.
- Require Protobuf development tooling for the minimal generated Antigravity message contract without adding gRPC++.

### Fixed
- Keep native provider backends stable when resolving provider configuration keys.
- Declare the cost-view delegate model explicitly for Qt 6.11 bound-component behavior.

## [14.0.1] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Restore keyboard focus and arrow-key selection in the provider source list.

## [14.0.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added
- Add a dependency-safe startup screen that can explain a missing, older, or newer native plugin before loading the native QML module.
- Add one source-readiness contract for provider and detected local-tool configuration, verification state, result quality, and recovery actions.
- Add Guided first success for choosing one goal, configuring only required fields, and running a read-only verification without inference.
- Add direct QML behavior coverage for dependency bootstrap, guided setup, provider Settings transactions, and Overview state.

### Changed
- Replace the provider settings wall with a searchable source list, monitoring-level filters, and one selected detail pane.
- Split Overview into reporting providers, collapsed connection checks, local tools, and actionable source problems.
- Report actual provider data, gateway data, balances, local estimates, and connectivity as distinct outcomes across setup and daily use.
- Move installed-system recovery into native Diagnostics with frontend/plugin identity, install layers, database health, source readiness, and redacted copy actions.
- Refresh the README, user guide, wiki sources, AppStream copy, and screenshot brief around first successful use.

### Fixed
- Discard staged KWallet edits when Settings is cancelled or closed; write or remove secrets only when Apply succeeds.
- Add complete settings and refresh bindings for every catalog provider.

## [13.0.0] — 2026-07-17

### Added
- Add Provider Metric Contract v2 with nullable values and source, quality, scope, window, observation, currency, and reset metadata.
- Add transactional SQLite observation schema v4 with a pre-v13 backup and compatibility projections for existing QML.
- Add Catalog v5 adapter profiles, a C++ `ProviderManager`, and descriptor-driven LiteLLM, Cerebras, Fireworks, and Perplexity integrations.
- Add Gemini read-only dynamic model discovery and a release-blocking non-invasive monitoring gate.

### Changed
- Replace scheduled OpenAI-compatible and Azure completion probes with read-only model discovery; billable inference tests are explicit manual actions.
- Move OpenRouter monitoring to `/api/v1/key` and retain native daily, weekly, monthly, remaining-limit, and reset fields.
- Stop presenting published Gemini and Veo caps as live remaining quota.
- Display unavailable provider metrics as Unknown and document scheduled traffic in Trust Center.
- Refresh the canonical KDE screenshots and deterministic demo fixtures around the four v13 launch providers.
- Make release validation fully reproducible without provider API keys, vendor accounts, KWallet entries, or billable probes.

### Fixed
- Include typed `usage_api` gateway spend in provider cards, monthly exposure, and compact panel totals while preserving unavailable costs as `Unknown`.
- Isolate demo and screenshot sessions from KWallet at the native secrets boundary and route descriptor adapters only to the deterministic mock endpoint.
- Align the OpenRouter demo fixture with the native v13 `GET /key` payload and gate all launch-provider demo routes with an executable contract test.
- Publish stable directly from an annotated tag that shares one commit with `origin/main`; beta, RC, and timed soak gates are not required.
- Stabilize the DeepSeek probe regression test by waiting for its parallel read-only refresh to finish before starting a manual diagnostic.

## [12.0.3] — 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- Drive every provider model picker from Provider Catalog v4 so Settings no longer advertises stale or invalid Claude, Gemini, Groq, xAI, Ollama, OpenRouter, Cohere, or Veo model IDs.
- Keep model pickers editable for custom gateways and newly released models while using the reviewed catalog as the visible source of truth.
- Reject deprecated or retired provider defaults in the release gate and add a regression check requiring all 14 provider pickers to remain catalog-driven.

## [12.0.2] — 2026-07-13

### Added
- Add GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna to the OpenAI catalog and move the OpenAI/OpenRouter defaults to GPT-5.6 Terra.
- Parse Codex's live 5-hour and weekly quota windows, including remaining percentages and reset timestamps, from the existing local Codex login.

### Changed
- Refresh current provider model IDs, prices, defaults, and lifecycle metadata for Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Groq, xAI, Ollama Cloud, OpenRouter, Together AI, Cohere, Google Veo, and AWS Bedrock.
- Prefer local Codex authentication for quota sync while retaining the browser-account request as a compatibility fallback.

### Fixed
- Snapshot Firefox's cookie WAL and shared-memory files so recently updated login cookies are visible while Firefox is running.
- Reassemble chunked Auth.js session cookies used by current ChatGPT sessions.
- Feed live Codex quota windows into subscription cards instead of displaying only static plan presets.

## [12.0.1] — 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- Restore native QML plugin discovery in Fedora/system installs by shipping the Linux module as `libaiusagemonitorplugin.so` instead of the build-only filename accepted by the previous smoke harness.
- Declare the tab delegate's required `modelData` property so the v12 popup renders without a Qt 6.11 `ReferenceError`.
- Make the strict QML import smoke use only the actual installed Linux plugin filename, preventing this packaging regression from passing CI again.

## [12.0.0] — 2026-07-13

### Added
- Add typed provider lifecycle, error, refresh reason, metric source and freshness contracts with deterministic retry scheduling.
- Add observation schema v3 with explicit period semantics, source, quality, model scope, correlation IDs and currency-aware queries.
- Add Provider Catalog v4, a C++ Browser Sync boundary, async history/export workers, reliability fixtures and split CI gates.

### Changed
- Coalesce provider refreshes, target configuration changes, cache KWallet reads and refresh stale providers on popup open.
- Group spend by ISO currency throughout the UI, notifications, Prometheus and Analyst views; mixed currencies are never silently summed.
- Split the popup into lazy Overview, History and Analyst views and migrate the native plugin to `qt_add_qml_module()`.
- Stream large JSON/CSV exports from forward-only SQL queries with atomic output files.
- Define COPR/source builds as full supported distributions and label the KDE Store plasmoid as frontend-only.

### Removed
- Remove the non-functional Flatpak scaffold, tracked v7 release tarball, periodic secret polling and error-text control flow.

### Release status
- Released through the v12.0.3 correctness line; historical RC verification is tracked in the release checklist.

## [11.0.0] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- Add DeepSeek v4 Flash and v4 Pro catalog entries and mark the legacy `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner` compatibility aliases with the official 2026-07-24 deprecation note.
- Add v11 release checklist coverage for COPR Fedora 43/44 build verification, RPM install/update/remove smoke checks, and issue #12 follow-through.

### Changed
- Refresh Provider Catalog v3 and Subscription Catalog v1 to `catalogVersion: 2026.06.30`, `release: 11.0.0`, and `lastReviewed: 2026-06-30`.
- Refresh provider and subscription source references against official pricing/model/plan pages, keeping manual-review flags visible where exact pricing, route, region, unit, or rebrand semantics remain ambiguous.
- Make Fedora COPR/RPM installation the primary documented Fedora path.
- Switch the default DeepSeek model to `deepseek-v4-flash` while preserving compatibility aliases for existing configurations.

### Fixed
- Keep GitHub Copilot Auto billing mode visible after the 2026-06-01 AI credits transition so the UI and `subscription_tools` regression test agree.

### Known Metadata Uncertainty
- Provider manual-review entries remain for Anthropic, Google, Mistral, DeepSeek, Groq, xAI, Ollama Cloud, OpenRouter, Together AI, Cohere, Google Veo, Azure OpenAI, and AWS Bedrock.
- Windsurf remains a visible subscription source-conflict while public Windsurf, Devin, and Cognition-branded pages describe overlapping plan and quota semantics.

## [10.0.1] — 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- Import the AI Usage Monitor plugin module in `ProviderCard.qml` so the installed v10 provider cards can resolve `ProviderPricingCatalog` when rendering catalog review, source-conflict, and unknown-pricing badges.

## [10.0.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- Add source-aware provider state for actual usage, probe usage, cost source, usage source, currency, and data quality.
- Add source-aware SQLite snapshot columns, CSV/JSON export fields, Prometheus source labels, and Analyst summary confidence flags.
- Add `scripts/check_config_defaults_exist_in_catalog.py` to block provider default-model drift in `just check`, `just release-check`, and CTest.
- Add OpenAI Costs API object-amount, legacy numeric fallback, empty result, malformed JSON, retry-after, non-USD warning, and probe-isolation regression tests.

### Changed
- Parse OpenAI Costs API `amount.value` directly and warn on non-USD currencies; only legacy numeric mock data uses cents-to-dollars conversion.
- Treat OpenAI-compatible and Azure chat-completion health checks as connectivity probes, not user usage or spend.
- Rework first-run onboarding around monitoring goals, data level, quick presets, and source/data-quality review.
- Expand Diagnostics with wallet, Copilot token, catalog review, Browser Sync readiness, insecure URL, install-shadowing, and support-report actions.
- Separate dashboard, compact, Prometheus, and card labels for API spend, subscription fees, estimated burn, and monthly exposure.
- Make Copilot/Bedrock/webhook secret loading react to wallet state and delayed key availability, and make subscription plan changes apply without a Plasma reload.
- Refresh Provider Catalog v3 and Subscription Catalog v1 release metadata to 2026-05-12 while keeping remaining manual-review entries visible.

### Fixed
- Fix fresh-install defaults for OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and AWS Bedrock so they resolve to shipped catalog model IDs.
- Remove hardcoded provider/tool alert threshold decisions from refresh and card logic so configured warning, critical, and budget thresholds drive UI and notifications.

### Known Metadata Uncertainty
- Provider manual-review entries remain for Anthropic, Google, Mistral, DeepSeek, Groq, xAI, Ollama Cloud, OpenRouter, Together AI, Cohere, Google Veo, and AWS Bedrock.
- Subscription manual-review/source-conflict entries remain visible for Windsurf and subscription catalog conflict tracking.

## [9.0.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- Add schema-v2 configuration export/import that covers every non-secret KConfig key while keeping API keys, browser cookies, PATs, and webhook URLs in KWallet.
- Add catalog review items to `CatalogLoader` so Diagnostics can show the provider or subscription entries that need manual review or have source conflicts.
- Add config-portability validation and stricter catalog-review reason checks to local, CTest, Fedora 44, and CI validation.

### Changed
- Refresh Provider Catalog v3 and Subscription Catalog v1 for the Confidence release with 2026-05-08 review dates and user-visible review/conflict reasons.
- Resolve JetBrains AI subscription metadata from source-conflict to official range-based pricing and quota labels.
- Expand Diagnostics with loaded plugin path, richer Trust Center catalog details, and clearer config portability copy.
- Refresh the roadmap, README, AppStream, and RPM metadata around v9.0.0 Confidence.

### Removed
- Remove the stale standalone `SetupWizard.qml` path so first-run activation has one maintained inline onboarding path.

## [8.0.3] — 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- Add automatic self-tracked fallback limits for subscription tools whose vendors expose plan allowances qualitatively or as multipliers but do not return live used/limit fields.
- Show Codex and similar local-activity monitors with progress bars while keeping the data source distinct from official live quota sync.

## [8.0.2] — 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- Preserve the existing Codex `Pro` plan position so legacy plan index `3` continues to resolve to ChatGPT Pro rather than the newly added Pro $100 tier.

## [8.0.1] — 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- Add official GitHub Copilot premium-request defaults for Free, Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise so configured Copilot Pro+ shows its plan and monthly limit instead of falling back to Free with a zero cap.
- Add current ChatGPT Pro $100 and Pro $200 Codex usage metadata, including official usage multipliers where OpenAI publishes ratios instead of exact message counts.
- Keep configured Codex Pro tiers when ChatGPT browser sync returns an entitlement but no live quota fields, and surface a catalog-fallback sync status instead of silently downgrading to Plus.

## [8.0.0] — 2026-05-06

### Added
- Add Provider Catalog v3 and Subscription Catalog v1 as local source-of-truth JSON catalogs for model pricing, subscription plans, quota windows, source refs, review dates, precision, and manual-review/source-conflict states.
- Add `CatalogLoader`, `ProviderPricingCatalog`, and `SubscriptionPlanCatalog` plus QML catalog status for schema, catalog version, review date, runtime-scraping state, stale/valid state, and review/conflict counts.
- Add quota-window UI rows with readable source badges for synced, official, official range/approx/note, self-tracked, custom, estimated, needs-review, and unknown data.
- Add subscription catalog and hardcoded-pricing validation scripts and wire them into CTest, `just check`, `just release-check`, and `just fedora44-check`.

### Changed
- Move subscription plan defaults, quota presets, Copilot billing modes, and provider/model token pricing out of C++/QML defaults and into shipped catalogs.
- Add stable string plan ID config keys while keeping old integer plan indexes as migration fallbacks.
- Switch Copilot billing mode to `auto`, `premium_requests_legacy`, and `ai_credits_usage_based` with a date-aware 2026-06-01 helper.
- Replace fake token pricing for non-token Veo cost estimation with explicit video-second pricing metadata.

### Removed
- Remove the private server/API provider, compact KPI mode, demo endpoint, catalog row, and QML/C++ backend registration from the public app.

## [7.0.0] — 2026-04-30

### Added
- Add Fedora KDE 44 / Plasma 6.6 as the primary development, CI, demo, validation, and release target.
- Add `just fedora44-check` with actionable checks for Fedora version, Plasma tools, Qt6/KF6 dependencies, KWallet/libsecret, QML import paths, install shadowing, AppStream, rpmlint, source packaging, plasmoid packaging, and payload validation.
- Add Provider Catalog v2 static metadata plus `scripts/check_provider_catalog.py` to keep provider/model/pricing metadata maintainable without runtime scraping.
- Expand Diagnostics into a Trust Center for actual API usage, estimated cost, rate-limit-only data, local filesystem-derived data, Browser Sync Labs, catalog freshness, KWallet status, and provider health.
- Add Simple / Operator / Analyst popup modes, show-only-problems filtering, direct empty-state actions, adaptive refresh scheduling, and visible refresh/failure/database diagnostics.

### Changed
- Move CI to `fedora:44` and validate source/plasmoid package checks in CI.
- Generalize Fedora KDE demo setup to `scripts/demo/setup_fedora_kde_test_env.sh --fedora 44`.
- Update Copilot tracking language and configuration for premium requests, usage-based billing, credits mode, and configurable monthly reset assumptions.
- Improve Browser Sync Labs readiness for Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Brave, KWallet/libsecret safe storage, cookie DB readability, and safe local-estimation fallback messaging.
- Keep v7.0.0 explicitly Plasma-native and local-first; backend services, web dashboards, PostgreSQL, and multi-user features remain out of scope.

## [6.0.1] — 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- Fixed version drift across the repository (updated to 6.0.1).
- Ensured `plugin/CMakeLists.txt` is consistent with `qmlRegisterType` calls in `plugin/aiusageplugin.cpp`.
- Updated documentation and roadmap to reflect 6.0.1 stabilization release.

## [6.0.0] — 2026-04-23

### Added
- **First-Run Guided Setup:** A simplified onboarding flow for new users, offering a "Recommended" path to quickly connect top providers.
- **Basic / Advanced Settings Mode:** Hides complex configurations (like custom base URLs, tier selection, deployments) behind an Advanced Mode toggle to reduce visual clutter for everyday users.
- **Data Trust & Confidence Labeling:** Provider cards now clearly indicate the type of data being displayed (Actual, Estimated, Rate-limit only, Local, Subscription-plan derived) and health status (Healthy, Degraded, Disconnected).
- **Diagnostics Center:** A dedicated config tab showing KWallet health, Browser Sync readiness, installed CLI tools, and quick access to run the deep system doctor script.
- **Config Portability:** Export and import non-secret configurations to share presets or backup UI settings safely.
- **Configuration Presets:** Quick one-click setups for common scenarios: Solo Developer, Multi-Provider, Local-First, Budget Watch, and Local Operator.
- **Compact Panel Upgrades:** Pin new key metrics directly in the compact Plasma panel view: Daily Cost, Remaining Requests, or Most Critical Provider.
- **Analyst & History Redesign:** Refined history controls, updated compare mode to look like a first-class view, and improved ranking panels in TrendSummary.
- **Config Screen Polish:** Updated all configuration screens to follow the new v6 visual language with improved spacing, grouping, and context hints.

### Changed
- **Dashboard Actionability:** Replaced static dashboard summaries with actionable insights: Top Risk, Budget Left Today, and Next Reset.
- **Browser Sync to Labs:** Explicitly marked Browser Sync as an experimental Labs feature to set correct reliability expectations.

## [5.4.1] — 2026-04-22

## [5.2.0] — 2026-04-09

### Added

- Add `ProviderCatalog.qml`, `ProviderRegistry.qml`, `NotificationController.qml`, `RefreshScheduler.qml`, and `RuntimeCoordinator.qml` to split provider metadata, notification routing, refresh scheduling, and startup wiring out of `main.qml`
