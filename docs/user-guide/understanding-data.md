# Understand the data

Provider cards answer different questions because provider APIs expose different information. Check the source and quality labels before comparing providers or setting a budget.

Overview prioritizes the source that needs action in one **Daily focus**, then
shows non-overlapping live-quota, reset, and spend facts. Source rows are ordered
by attention, provider-reported data, estimates or balances, connectivity-only
checks, and unavailable data. Open a row for Source Detail; it keeps metric
availability, freshness, provenance, coverage, and compatible recent history
visible without treating a connection check as usage. The same daily state
drives the panel and notifications.

The panel and popup footer use the same source summary. **Active sources** means
sources with verified actual data, an estimate, or a balance; connectivity-only
and needs-attention sources are called out separately. A verified local tool can
therefore be active even when no API provider is configured.

## Monitoring levels

| Level | What the widget can establish |
| --- | --- |
| Actual usage and spend | The provider reports account usage, billing, or both |
| Actual key usage | The provider reports usage attached to the current API key |
| Gateway aggregate | A gateway such as LiteLLM reports traffic and spend that passed through it |
| Balance and connectivity | The provider reports a balance and confirms account access |
| Connectivity only | A read-only request confirms credentials or model access, but not usage or billing |

The generated [provider capability matrix](../provider-capabilities.md) is the exact contract used by the runtime.

Anthropic can occupy two levels at once: its standard key can prove
connectivity while its optional Admin key reports organization usage and cost.
The two capabilities retain separate availability and failure states. Cache
read and cache-creation input tokens remain explicit metric kinds, and Priority
Tier usage does not imply that Priority Tier cost is available.

## Source labels

- **Actual API usage** comes from a provider usage endpoint.
- **Billing API** means the provider supplied spend.
- **Estimated pricing** combines observed tokens with the reviewed local pricing catalog.
- **Response headers** contain rate-limit values returned with a request.
- **Local tool data** comes from local files and counters.
- **Browser Sync Labs** comes from an authenticated browser or CLI session.
- **Published documentation** describes a plan or cap, not live remaining quota.

An estimate is useful for trends but is not an invoice. A connectivity check proves that an endpoint answered; it does not prove that usage is zero.

## Lowest quota and next reset

**Lowest live quota** is the smallest remaining percentage among compatible
provider-reported or synchronized quota windows. **Next live reset** is the
earliest future reset from those same windows. Ties are deterministic.

Published plan documentation, a locally configured activity limit, and an
unknown quota can still appear on their source card, but they cannot drive the
Overview headline or compact quota/reset modes. A stale snapshot remains visible
as stale but does not generate a fresh threshold-change notification.

## Unknown and zero

**Unknown** means the source did not provide a compatible value. Zero means the source explicitly reported zero. The widget preserves that distinction in the UI, database, exports, alerts, and Prometheus output.

Compact cost modes include only available provider-reported spend and keep each
currency separate. Remaining requests show an em dash when no compatible metric
exists and `0 req` only when a source explicitly reports zero.

The Analyst activity heatmap uses a neutral cell for both missing days and
explicit zero activity. Hover text distinguishes them: only a missing day says
**No recorded data**. The **Output / Input Ratio** is descriptive, not a score of
prompt quality. It appears only when compatible snapshots contain positive input
tokens; a reported zero output remains a valid ratio of zero.

## Currency handling

The widget does not convert currencies. It keeps observations in their reported ISO currency and does not silently add USD and EUR. USD budgets turn off when the observed data uses another currency.

LiteLLM spend logs may contain several currencies. Each remains separate.
Analyst pauses cost-derived KPIs for mixed currencies unless one compatible
currency is explicitly selected. Compatible token, request, and local-tool
activity remains available.

## Analyst sample requirements

Analyst derives results only from compatible observations in the requested UTC
period:

- average daily spend requires 3 recorded days
- volatility and anomaly candidates require 7 recorded days
- week-over-week change requires two complete 7-day windows and a non-zero previous window
- output/input ratio requires 3 compatible days with positive input

Unavailable results show the observed and required sample counts. Anomaly
candidates must exceed the period mean by two population standard deviations
and by at least one currency unit or 50 percent of the baseline. They are
candidates for review, not causal conclusions.

## Time windows

Daily, weekly, monthly, rolling, and cumulative values are not interchangeable. History keeps the source window and aggregation meaning. A rolling provider value is not relabeled as calendar-day spend.

## Background traffic

Scheduled provider calls are read-only and do not run inference. The Trust Center lists the scheduled endpoint and request budget for each provider.

Some settings pages offer an explicit manual inference test. That action may use quota or incur a small provider charge. It does not run on the background schedule.

## Budgets

Create policies only when the source has compatible spend data and a reviewed
Budget Policy v2 catalog contract. A policy based on estimated pricing remains
an estimate. Connectivity-only providers cannot produce meaningful guidance.

Policy limits and results use checked ISO-currency minor units. Actual and
estimated values, currencies and aggregate/scoped dimensions never mix. An
unknown currency precision, missing observation, unstable reset or incompatible
scope is unavailable rather than zero.

Calendar policies keep their saved IANA time zone and resolve local boundaries
to exact UTC half-open intervals. Safe today and remaining daily allowance use
remaining local calendar time; completed-day forecasting excludes the current
incomplete UTC day. See [Budget Control and runway guardrails](runway-guardrails.md).

## Runway guardrails

Runway is a deterministic interpretation of compatible local history, not a
provider promise. Quota runway projects whether remaining requests or tokens
reach zero before the reported reset. Budget pacing projects compatible
completed-day spend through the policy's resolved day, ISO week, calendar
month or anchored-month period.

The current day is excluded from budget baselines, missing days are never
filled with zero, and actual and estimated spend remain separate. A warning or
critical result includes evidence, coverage, method, and timing. If a contract
requirement is missing, the result is unavailable rather than guessed.

See [Runway guardrails](runway-guardrails.md) for the exact thresholds,
scope/privacy boundary, notification defaults, and Prometheus semantics.

## Quota observation and countdowns

Live quota requires a valid authenticated observation. Local file activity and a
successful response without quota do not refresh an older quota observation.
Quota observations older than 15 minutes, or windows whose reset has passed,
are withheld from the panel's live selection until new data arrives. Source
Detail retains explicit last-known values and observation times.

The lowest remaining quota and next reset are independent. For example, a weekly
window with 10% remaining can be the lowest quota while a five-hour window with
80% remaining resets first. Reset countdowns share one presentation clock;
updating the displayed time does not itself call a provider.

Automatic recovery requests coalesce after a missed wake interval or network
recovery. Authentication and permission failures require corrective action.
Rate-limited browser and API requests honor Retry-After; transient failures wait
before retrying. Use source settings to repair credentials and explicitly verify
the source after repair.
