# Privacy and security

AI Usage Monitor is local-first. It has no telemetry, account service, hosted database, or cloud sync.

## Data stored locally

| Data | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Provider keys and webhook URLs | KWallet folder used by AI Usage Monitor |
| Usage history | Local SQLite database under the user's data directory |
| Widget preferences | Plasma configuration |
| Export files | Directory selected by the user |

Configuration exports exclude keys, tokens, cookies, personal access tokens and
webhook URLs. Explicit schema-v3 backups can contain policy scope identities
needed for restoration; they are sensitive local backups, not diagnostics.

Anthropic's standard and Admin API keys are separate KWallet entries. The
widget never copies one into the other. Provider report rows and policies may
include model, project, workspace, service-tier or line-item identifiers. Those
raw scopes stay in local schema-v6 data and are excluded from diagnostics,
support reports, standard reports, webhook payloads and Prometheus labels.

Schema v6 adds owner-isolated policy definitions, one-shot migration markers,
current policy state and persist-before-delivery policy events for warning,
critical, exceeded, recovered and reset. Forecast rows remain ephemeral and
are never written into raw observation history as provider facts. Migration
from schema v5 is transactional and creates a `.v18-backup` first.

## Network traffic

Enabled providers connect directly to their configured API endpoints. Scheduled calls are read-only and listed in the generated capability matrix. Manual inference tests are explicit and may consume quota or money.

OpenAI and Anthropic organization reports use read-only endpoints, bounded
pagination, and never send a message or inference request. Forecast
calculations read local SQLite history only and make no network request.

Remote custom base URLs must use HTTPS. Plain HTTP is accepted only for loopback development endpoints.

The optional Prometheus server binds to 127.0.0.1. Guardrail metrics aggregate
by provider, risk kind, and actual/estimated value class; they do not add model,
project, workspace, scope, stable-ID, or API-key labels.

Slack and Discord webhooks send alert content to the configured webhook service.
Policy notifications use an allow-listed payload containing provider display
name, risk, coarse percentage class, period and local link text. Daily and
policy alerts do not include endpoint URLs, account, raw scope or policy
identifiers, credentials, cookies, unrestricted backend errors or wallet
contents.

Budget Control performs no provider-side mutation. It cannot switch models,
write provider budgets or credentials, revoke keys or start billable inference.

## KWallet

The widget does not write provider keys to Plasma config files. If KWallet is unavailable, secret-backed providers cannot load their credentials. There is no insecure fallback.

## Browser Sync Labs

Browser Sync reads the selected local profile and uses the existing authenticated
session for a direct request to the service. It reads browser storage only when
Browser Sync Labs is enabled. Cookie data does not enter QML, diagnostics, logs,
history, or exports.

Temporary browser database copies use owner-only permissions. Browser Sync is disabled by default because it depends on undocumented service behavior.

Codex quota refresh is separate from Browser Sync. When Codex monitoring is
enabled, automatic startup, scheduled, and enable-time refreshes read the local
Codex login directly and never inspect browser cookies. An explicit Browser Sync
request may provide the selected browser session as a fallback if Codex local
auth cannot complete. Claude session sync remains available only through enabled
Browser Sync, and its browser-sync circuit breaker does not block automatic
Codex local-auth refresh.

## Antigravity local monitoring

Antigravity monitoring connects only to a language-server process owned by the current user and listening on loopback. The widget validates the executable layout and pins the localhost certificate shipped with the detected Antigravity installation. Its CSRF value remains in memory and is never logged, persisted, diagnosed, or exported.

The monitor reads only account status and quota-summary RPCs. It does not read Antigravity prompts, conversations, OAuth tokens, logs, or the separate `gemini.google.com` session.

## Support reports

Native Diagnostics builds the support report in the compiled plugin. It includes only allowlisted source IDs, readiness states, typed error kinds, next-action keys, and whether verification has succeeded. It excludes endpoint hosts, query strings, account IDs, project IDs, credentials, cookies, webhook URLs, free-form backend errors, and KWallet values. The dependency-recovery screen has a smaller redacted bootstrap report that omits error details and paths. Review either report before posting it publicly.

## Removing local data

Removing the RPM leaves user data in place. Delete history from the widget's History settings when possible. Remove stored keys through provider settings or KWallet Manager.

Do not delete the whole wallet to remove this widget's entries.
