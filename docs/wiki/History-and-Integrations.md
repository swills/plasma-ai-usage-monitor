# History and integrations

History is local and optional. Enable only the outputs you plan to use.

## History

Open **Settings → History** to enable recording and choose a retention period from 7 to 365 days. The default is 90 days.

Runway calculations use the same local observations. Enabling forecast
notifications also enables the local database for the minimum observation and
transition evidence even when the general History switch is off.

The popup provides:

- a detail view for one provider or subscription tool
- comparison charts across compatible sources
- cost, token, request, and rate-limit metrics
- 24-hour, 7-day, 30-day, and 90-day ranges
- an Analyst view with activity, change, volatility, anomalies, and top drivers

Sources with retained data remain selectable after they are disabled. A source
that is no longer part of the current catalog is labeled **History only**.
Metric choices appear only when compatible stored observations exist.

Only compatible units, measurement semantics, and currencies can be compared.
The comparison explains why it was rejected instead of combining incompatible
values. Unknown values remain absent rather than becoming zero, and missing
time buckets appear as chart gaps. Coverage text below the chart reports stored
samples, plotted points, gaps, stale data, and history-only state.

Analyst loads one background snapshot for its exact 30-day period. It starts
with coverage and then shows only sections supported by compatible history:
spend, activity, top drivers, anomaly candidates, and a written summary.
Insufficient history is explained as unavailable instead of appearing as
`0.0`. Actual and estimated spend stay labeled separately. Mixed currencies
pause spend analysis without hiding compatible token, request, or local-tool
activity.

**Output / Input Ratio** is available only after at least three days with
compatible snapshots and positive input tokens. It is a neutral relationship
between two reported quantities, not a quality, productivity, prompt-clarity,
or efficiency score.

The 7-day and 30-day copy actions each build a report from their own period.
Reports include coverage, currency status, actual and estimated sample counts,
unavailable explanations, and the analysis method. Provider and installation
diagnostics remain under **Settings → Diagnostics**.

History and Analyst requests are asynchronous. Changing source, metric, range,
or report period supersedes the older request; a late result cannot replace the
newer selection.

The database is stored at:

~~~text
~/.local/share/plasma-ai-usage-monitor/usage_history.db
~~~

Use the History settings page to inspect its size or prune rows older than the retention period.

## JSON and CSV export

The popup's **Export file** action writes the selected series as JSON or CSV.
Copying CSV to the clipboard is available as a separate secondary action.
History settings can also write JSON or CSV on a schedule.

Choose a directory you own. Scheduled export writes atomically so a partial run does not replace the last complete file.

Schema-v6 exports contain usage observations, source metadata, legacy guardrail
transitions and policy transition evidence. They do not contain API keys,
browser cookies, personal access tokens or webhook URLs. Explicit local history
exports can contain raw provider scope identifiers, so review them before
sharing.

## Configuration backup

Open **Settings → Diagnostics** to export or import non-secret settings. Schema
v3 includes settings and the current applet's policies; schema v2 remains a
settings-only import. All objects are validated before Apply and policy
replacement is atomic.

Policy scope identities can appear in an explicit schema-v3 backup because they
are needed for exact restore. Treat the file as sensitive and do not attach it
to public diagnostics or bug reports.

Secrets remain in KWallet and must be configured separately on a new computer.

## Prometheus

Enable the metrics endpoint under History and choose an unused port. The server
binds to `127.0.0.1` by default.

Example check for the default port:

~~~bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:9464/metrics
~~~

Use a local Prometheus instance or an explicitly configured local forwarder
when possible. **Listen on all IPv4 interfaces** is an explicit opt-in for a
Prometheus server on another host. It binds to `0.0.0.0`; the endpoint has no
authentication or TLS, so restrict the selected port with a host or network
firewall. Anyone who can connect can read the exported metrics.

Guardrail metrics use fixed source/risk/value-class labels.
Authenticated local-tool quota windows are exported as
`ai_usage_tool_quota_percent_remaining`, labeled by tool, window kind, source,
and quality. `ai_usage_tool_quota_reset_timestamp_seconds` exports the reset as
a Unix timestamp when the source provides one. The older
`ai_usage_tool_percent_used` series remains the self-tracked plan estimate and
must not be treated as live quota.

`ai_usage_guardrail_risk_state` uses `0` unavailable, `1` safe, `2` warning,
`3` critical and `4` exceeded.
`ai_usage_guardrail_seconds_until_event` appears only when a predicted event
exists. Their labels are limited to provider, risk kind, and actual/estimated
value class.

Import `docs/grafana-dashboard.json` into Grafana for a starter dashboard. Pick
the Prometheus data source and, if necessary, select a subscription tool from
the dashboard variable.

## Slack and Discord webhooks

Webhooks use the same alert pipeline as KDE notifications.

1. Open **Settings → Alerts**.
2. Enable alerts and the required event types.
3. Enable Slack or Discord.
4. Paste the incoming webhook URL.
5. Set a webhook cooldown.

Webhook URLs are stored in KWallet. Alerts can contain provider names, status, and usage or budget context, so treat the destination as part of your data boundary.

Policy alerts are configured per policy under **Settings → Budget Control**.
They fire only for warning, critical, exceeded, real recovery and period reset.
Schema-v6 state/events persist before delivery and suppress the same transition
after refresh or restart. DND, cooldown and failed delivery remain pending or
suppressed rather than disappearing. Raw model, project, workspace, line-item,
policy and API-key identifiers are not sent.

## Alert tuning

Start with provider disconnect, reconnect, and API errors. Add budget warnings only for providers with compatible spend data. Set Do Not Disturb hours and a cooldown to avoid repeated notifications during a provider outage.

Existing global alert, Do Not Disturb, cooldown and per-provider switches still
apply. A policy snooze ends automatically when its next period begins.
