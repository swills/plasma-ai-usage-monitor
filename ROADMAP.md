# Roadmap

**Current release:** 20.0.0, Reliable Daily Quotas

**Last updated:** 2026-09-07

## Release in preparation: 20.0.0 Reliable Daily Quotas

Make quota, reset, freshness, and recovery consistent across the panel, tooltip,
Overview, and Source Detail. Reuse the prepared fixes in PRs #49 and #50, then:

1. Separate authenticated quota freshness from local activity and select the
   earliest reset independently of the lowest remaining quota.
2. Consolidate daily presentation and qualify panel orientation, scaling,
   localization, unavailable values, and real zeroes.
3. Add per-entry subscription evidence lifecycle and distinguish account
   entitlement, published pricing, and local activity targets.
4. Produce repeatable isolated Plasma evidence for exact candidate qualification.
5. Update user documentation and verify the release on Fedora before publication.

The plan is finalized. Remaining CI, media, and physical desktop qualification
are deferred to the v20 release stage by the owner; they are not marked passed.
Implementation is in progress; publication remains pending. The detailed review, acceptance cases, and
delivery phases are in the
[v20 plan](docs/plans/PLASMA_AI_USAGE_MONITOR_V20_CODEX_PLAN.md).

AI Usage Monitor remains a desktop-native, local-first Plasma widget. v19 adds
verified cost intelligence, signed catalog activation, deterministic pricing
dimensions, immutable estimate provenance, drift visibility, and fail-closed
expiry behavior. It does not add provider writes, FX, inference, or a fourth
popup tab.

## Current release

### 20.0.0 Reliable Daily Quotas

Prepared locally; publication is pending final qualification. Quota observation
freshness, independently selected reset times, normalized tooltip presentation,
and subscription evidence lifecycle are the focus. The versioned checklist
records current evidence and remaining gates.

### 19.0.1 Catalog Drift Reliability

- Separate expected lifecycle, unavailable-pricing, and transient network
  review states from actionable catalog drift.
- Refresh Catalog v7 evidence and current Gemini pricing without enabling
  runtime scraping or automatic price activation.
- Keep the native Google backend default aligned with an active catalog model.

### 19.0.0 Verified Cost Intelligence

- Replace runtime input/output price copies with one exact-match Cost Engine v2.
- Ship Catalog v7 metadata for cache reads/writes, context tiers, service tiers,
  lifecycle, evidence, sequence, and hard expiry.
- Persist estimate provenance in snapshots, normalized observations, and exports.
- Verify signed remote catalogs before atomic activation and reject rollback,
  expiry, schema, and digest failures.
- Explain estimates in Source Detail and surface review, conflict, unknown-price,
  and retirement-watch states in the existing provider surfaces.
- Qualify the exact release commit before GitHub, COPR, and KDE Store publication.

The implementation plan is
[`docs/plans/PLASMA_AI_USAGE_MONITOR_V19_CODEX_PLAN.md`](docs/plans/PLASMA_AI_USAGE_MONITOR_V19_CODEX_PLAN.md).

### 18.0.0 Budget Control

- Replace fixed runtime budgets with validated aggregate or scoped policies.
- Add schema v6, config schema v3, calendar/time-zone-aware billing cycles and
  deterministic minor-unit pacing.
- Show safe today, remaining daily allowance, projection, previous period and
  `Unattributed` scope reconciliation.
- Persist warning, critical, exceeded, recovery and reset transitions before
  delivery, with restart deduplication and period snooze.
- Keep external payloads allow-listed and Prometheus labels low-cardinality.
- Preserve exact v17/v18 popup evidence, Fedora lifecycle, reproducible
  artifacts and public readback as release-blocking proof.

## Previous release

### 17.0.0 Runway Guardrails

- Make OpenAI usage and daily/monthly cost pagination bounded, cursor-complete,
  and failure-safe before forecasts consume totals.
- Add Forecast Contract v1, transactional schema v5, deterministic quota runway,
  and completed-UTC-day monthly budget pacing.
- Show provider-reported model, project, workspace, service-tier, and line-item
  detail without inferring dimensions or double counting aggregates.
- Integrate guardrails into Daily Focus, Source Detail, Analyst, and Settings
  without a fourth primary tab.
- Add opt-in, transition-only, restart-deduplicated notifications and
  aggregate-only Prometheus guardrail metrics.
- Preserve v16 configuration, KWallet secrets, observation history, package
  identity, actual/estimated separation, and currency boundaries.

The implementation plan is
[`docs/plans/PLASMA_AI_USAGE_MONITOR_V18_CODEX_PLAN.md`](docs/plans/PLASMA_AI_USAGE_MONITOR_V18_CODEX_PLAN.md).
Phases 0 through 6 and local Phase 7 qualification are complete. Public
publication requires exact-tag artifacts and readback from every named surface.

## Current priorities

### Protect daily truth

- Keep unavailable values distinct from real numeric zeroes.
- Keep lowest-quota and next-reset modes limited to synchronized or provider-reported windows.
- Keep actual spend, estimates, balances, and fixed fees separate by currency.
- Keep deterministic recovery actions ahead of secondary dashboard detail.

### Useful retained history

- Preserve disabled-source history and explicit chart gaps.
- Compare only compatible units, semantics, scopes, windows, and currencies.
- Keep Analyst methodology, coverage, and sample requirements visible.
- Keep History and Analyst queries asynchronous and bounded at 100k observations.

### Reliable Fedora delivery

- Keep COPR as the supported Fedora package.
- Test clean install, update, rollback, removal, and user-data preservation.
- Detect mixed user-local and system versions before they cause QML plugin failures.
- Keep the native-plugin requirement before every KDE Store install action.

### Useful local integrations

- Improve scheduled exports and low-cardinality Prometheus labels while keeping
  loopback as the secure default and all-IPv4 listening as an explicit,
  unauthenticated opt-in.
- Keep webhook payloads small and explicit.
- Improve Browser Sync diagnostics while treating the feature as Labs.

## Non-goals

- hosted account or team service
- cloud database or cross-machine aggregation
- server-side telemetry
- runtime scraping of provider pricing pages
- automatic currency conversion
- a frontend-only package presented as a complete native installation
- non-Linux Browser Sync without a tested platform target
